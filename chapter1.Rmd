# 1. Tools and methods for open and reproducible research

I am very excited about this *Introduction to Open Data Science* course, as I feel that it offers an opportunity to learn data science and statistical tools, which I have been using in my own projects. I think that the Datacamp learning environment was a good choice for the course and it is very easy to use.
